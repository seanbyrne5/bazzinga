## Validation
My website passed validation checks on JSHint JavaScript Validator, W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator (Jigsaw). 




## Credits
I got the color pallets, images and icons from a website https://www.frontendmentor.io they offer coding challenges and points on completed submissions. When I chose the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game there was a downloadable file with all the svg images and icons as well as the colors to be used and design layout. I also used YouTube resources as a guide to build my website such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_H4_miTKsI as a base to build this game.
