# Bazinga!
![screenot of main home page](assets/images/homescreen.png)
Welcome to my version of the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. I have given my site the name of Bazinga, a homeage to the original creator of this game Sheldon Cooper. this game is designed using my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a game to help friends and family members enjoy a game with truly random results as it is statistically proven that people who  know each each other tend to tie playing with each other in the standard Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

This project was a real challenge, as this was my first experience with Javascript I struggled to begin this project so I found a mentor website called frontendmentor.io that assigns leveled challenges that provide the ential assets and layouts for the wensite. After creating an account and downloding the zip file I began building the HTML and CSS for this project. I used YouTube resourves and GitHub repositorirs like https://github.com/Conal2023/RPSLS/tree/main and https://github.com/Antonyeaster/deathly-wise-wizards?tab=readme-ov-file#Deployment for reference in building this website.

## Credits
I got the color pallets, images and icons from a website https://www.frontendmentor.io they offer coding challenges and points on completed submissions. When I chose the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game there was a downloadable file with all the svg images and icons as well as the colors to be used and design layout. I also used YouTube resources as a guide to build my website such as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_H4_miTKsI as a base to build this game.
 I used GitHub repositorirs like https://github.com/Conal2023/RPSLS/tree/main and https://github.com/Antonyeaster/deathly-wise-wizards?tab=readme-ov-file#Deployment for reference in building this website.
